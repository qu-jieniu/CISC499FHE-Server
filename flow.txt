User enter IP and port
	|
	| ---> Socket connection to server
	|      Check if can establish connection and if FHE service has started
	v
User create new session / use the old session
	|
	| ---> If using old session, fetch the old session by comparing the hashed value
	|      of the session # and private key. If doesn't match, create a new session
	v
new set post (X={x1,x2,...})
	|
	| ---> User enters local tag for set, and send HTTP (secure w/ HTTPS) post request to server. Request will include user id, session id, and set values
	|      (possibly hash of set?). The server will verify user, generate a new set id, and store the values on the DB. The server will then return the generated set
	|      id, which the client will associate with the local tag.
	v
new operation post ("set_1 + set_2 * set_3")
	|
	| ---> User enters new set tag, sends operation post request with equation of sets, these sets will be resolve from local tags to server IDs automatically.
	|      Server will parse the op request, and execute accordingly. Server will generate new set ID, store new set values, and return the ID which the client
	|      will associate accordingly.
